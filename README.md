GoodMorning / Afternoon / Evening. 

Please read the whole post before judging

It has been a while now since I have been banned. Since about 6th of december.

I asked a few people why and what I did but I dont understanded it at that moment. Sadly I did not get a lot of perspectives that could reforge my way of thinking / adjust my personal approach so I have to do it on my own with the little information I have.  

Seeing I got banned. I did something way of key and I cant like run in and ask about a unban.I need to think about it with little information that I have.


That will take a lot of time and perspective. Thats why I ask now for a unban and not like the day after I got banned.
 

I first looked at my feminine side.


Within a week researching my fineminine side. I got a fine for my car being double parked.


So this is a example of a joke I can not make on Etalyx Discord. I never did! But I did make a Rhyme joke that stirred up the simular confusion to people who do think that this is offencive. 


I did not get it the confussion because I never intend to approach it to in that kind of way.


I shall and will think about posting in the future. 


I dont know why the discord ban has to be connected to a twitch time-outs or bans. I never did something offencive on twitch I mainly supported Etal and the crew. 


Thats what really got me Riled up sadly. 


Not understanding that being timeout in twitch. I wont bring those problems to twitch I dont want to spoil the mood for the stream. I love the streams I dont want to bring any trouble to it.


Now thats for twitch.


I am confident of my approach to twitch. But for discord I rather be banned at the moment. I see where I am wrong but I think I still have a lot to process.


I would like to talk to Gnawg in a process of several weeks. Talking about how I should approach things. 


Why Gnawg you may ask? I think I may misjudged him from timing me out on twitch. Not discord. I think he is the perfect candidate because he saw my good but also my ugly side when things gone wrong.



I know its really to much to ask of you Gnawg. I know in your perspective, I am unsuiteble for discord right now. But I am willing to listen and behave. Your guidance would be precious to me. 



So this letter would probally not convice you guys to unban me I know.


But hopefully it shows I am willing to approach the matter. 

I will add Gnawg to my discord friendslist because its common knowledge you can not communicat with eachother if you are not on the same server. 

Happy chrismass and the best for the new year ahead.
